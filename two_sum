ANSWER:O(n)

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        seen={}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            difference=target-nums[i]
            if difference in seen:
                return [seen[difference],i]
            else:
                seen[nums[i]]=i



journey:
i had manually typed the input output statement like enter the value of list and target likewise(i am stupid) and got sense a bit later and removed and renamed the variables as described in the question
At first i manually used nested loop which had complexity of O(n^2)

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]  find complexity

suggestions from top solutions/chatgpt

could have used enumerate function-indexing inside the loop would have become better
