journey:
so as of starting i again implemented the nested loop
class Solution:
    def containsNearbyDuplicate(self, nums, k):
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1,len(nums)):
                if(nums[i]==nums[j] and abs(i-j)<=k):
                    return True
        return False  

  this has complexity of O(n^2)
#this has to be be reduced so trying it to implement in set
